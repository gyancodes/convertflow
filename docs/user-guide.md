# ConvertFlow User Guide

This comprehensive guide covers all features and functionality of ConvertFlow.

## Interface Overview

ConvertFlow uses a clean, step-by-step interface that guides you through the conversion process:

1. **Configure Settings**: Adjust conversion parameters
2. **Upload Files**: Select your PNG images
3. **Convert**: Process your images
4. **Download**: Get your SVG files

## Detailed Feature Guide

### 1. Configuration Panel

#### Algorithm Selection

**Auto (Recommended)**
- Automatically detects the best algorithm for your image
- Analyzes image characteristics to choose optimal processing
- Best choice for most users

**Shapes Algorithm**
- Optimized for logos, icons, and geometric graphics
- Excellent edge detection for clean lines
- Produces clean, simplified vector paths
- Best for: Logos, icons, simple illustrations

**Photo Algorithm**
- Designed for photographic content
- Advanced color quantization
- Preserves more detail and gradients
- Best for: Photographs, complex images, realistic artwork

**LineArt Algorithm**
- Specialized for line drawings and sketches
- Emphasizes edge detection and path tracing
- Minimal color processing
- Best for: Drawings, sketches, technical diagrams

#### Color Count (2-256)

Controls how many colors are used in the final SVG:

- **Low (2-8 colors)**: Simple graphics, logos, icons
- **Medium (16-32 colors)**: Balanced detail and simplicity
- **High (64-256 colors)**: Complex images, photographs

**Tips:**
- Start with 16 colors for most images
- Increase for complex images with many colors
- Decrease for simple graphics to reduce file size

#### Smoothing Level

Controls how smooth the vector paths are:

**Low Smoothing**
- Preserves sharp edges and corners
- More accurate to original image
- Larger file sizes
- Best for: Technical drawings, pixel art

**Medium Smoothing (Default)**
- Balanced approach
- Good for most image types
- Reasonable file sizes

**High Smoothing**
- Very smooth curves
- Smaller file sizes
- May lose some detail
- Best for: Organic shapes, logos

#### Path Simplification (0.1-10.0)

Controls how much paths are simplified:

- **Low (0.1-1.0)**: More detail, larger files
- **Medium (1.0-3.0)**: Balanced detail and size
- **High (3.0-10.0)**: Simplified paths, smaller files

#### Transparency Preservation

- **Enabled**: Maintains PNG transparency in SVG
- **Disabled**: Converts transparent areas to white
- Always enable for images with transparent backgrounds

### 3. Processing

#### Processing Stages

1. **Preprocessing**: Loading and preparing the image
2. **Color Quantization**: Reducing colors using K-means clustering
3. **Edge Detection**: Finding edges using Sobel or Canny algorithms
4. **Vectorization**: Converting edges to vector paths
5. **SVG Generation**: Creating the final SVG markup

#### Progress Monitoring

- **Stage Indicators**: Visual progress through each stage
- **Progress Bars**: Percentage completion for current stage
- **Time Estimates**: Approximate time remaining
- **Cancel Option**: Stop processing if needed

#### Performance Features

**Web Workers**

- Enable/disable in performance settings
- Automatic fallback if not supported

**Memory Monitoring**
- Real-time memory usage tracking
- Warnings for high memory usage
- Automatic optimization suggestions

### 4. Results and Download

#### Preview Comparison

- Side-by-side view of original PNG and converted SVG
- Zoom and pan functionality
- File size comparison
- Quality assessment

#### Download Options

**Single File Download**
- Click "Download SVG" for individual files
- Files saved with .svg extension
- Original filename preserved

**Batch Download**
- Automatic ZIP creation for multiple files
- All SVGs packaged together
- Convenient for bulk conversions

#### File Information

- Original file size vs SVG size
- Processing time
- Number of colors used
- Number of vector paths created

## Advanced Features

### Batch Processing

Convert multiple files with the same settings:

1. Upload multiple PNG files (up to 20)
2. Configure settings once
3. Process all files simultaneously
4. Download individually or as ZIP

### Error Recovery

ConvertFlow includes intelligent error recovery:

- **Automatic Fallback**: If advanced processing fails, simpler methods are tried
- **Memory Management**: Automatic optimization for large images
- **Retry Options**: Manual retry for failed conversions
- **Graceful Degradation**: Partial results when possible

### Performance Optimization

**For Large Images:**
- Images over 4096px are automatically resized
- Memory usage is monitored and optimized
- Processing is chunked to prevent browser freezing

**For Batch Processing:**
- Files are processed sequentially to manage memory
- Progress is tracked individually for each file
- Failed files don't stop the entire batch

## Best Practices

### Image Preparation

1. **Clean Your Images**
   - Remove noise and artifacts
   - Ensure good contrast
   - Crop unnecessary areas

2. **Optimize Size**
   - Don't use unnecessarily large images
   - 1000-2000px is usually sufficient
   - Consider the final use case

3. **Check Quality**
   - Ensure images are sharp and clear
   - Avoid heavily compressed PNGs
   - Use high-quality source images

### Settings Optimization

1. **Start Simple**
   - Use Auto algorithm initially
   - Begin with default settings
   - Adjust based on results

2. **Iterative Improvement**
   - Try different algorithms
   - Adjust color count gradually
   - Fine-tune smoothing and simplification

3. **Consider Use Case**
   - Web icons: Lower color count, higher simplification
   - Print graphics: Higher color count, lower simplification
   - Animations: Medium settings for balance

### Workflow Tips

1. **Test Small Batches**
   - Process 1-2 files first
   - Verify settings work well
   - Then process larger batches

2. **Save Successful Settings**
   - Note settings that work well for your image types
   - Create your own presets mentally
   - Document successful workflows

3. **Quality Check**
   - Always preview results before downloading
   - Compare file sizes
   - Test SVGs in your target application
